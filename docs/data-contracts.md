# AI User Personas Data Contracts

## Bottom Line

The first UI builds against one canonical `Persona` JSON contract plus a thin
repository/API boundary. Base persona screens can still use fixture data, while
the persona council workflow uses local JSON persistence through server actions.

Canonical schema:

- `schemas/persona.schema.json`
- `schemas/persona-roster.schema.json`
- `schemas/persona-review-run.schema.json`

## Persona Entity

Required fields:

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `schema_version` | string | Current value: `1.0.0`. |
| `id` | string | Stable id, format `persona_<slug>_<8hex>`. |
| `status` | enum | `draft`, `active`, or `archived`. |
| `name` | string | Display name for the persona. |
| `archetype` | string | Short persona category, for example `Operations skeptic`. |
| `role` | string | Job, user role, or audience role. |
| `summary` | string | One-paragraph overview. |
| `primary_goal` | string | Main outcome the user is trying to achieve. |
| `goals` | array | User goals, at least one item. |
| `frustrations` | array | User pains, at least one item. |
| `motivations` | array | Drivers behind behavior. |
| `behaviors` | array | Observed or inferred behavior patterns. |
| `needs` | array | Product needs or support needs. |
| `scenarios` | array | Contexts where this persona uses the product. |
| `evidence` | array | Source-backed evidence items, at least one item. |
| `confidence` | number | `0` to `1`. |
| `tags` | array | UI filtering and grouping labels. |
| `created_at` | string | ISO 8601 date-time. |
| `updated_at` | string | ISO 8601 date-time. |

Optional fields:

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `quote` | string | Representative quote. |
| `channels` | array | Preferred communication or discovery channels. |
| `tech_comfort` | enum | `low`, `medium`, or `high`. |
| `decision_style` | enum | `fast`, `deliberate`, `consensus`, or `authority-led`. |
| `notes` | string | Internal working notes. |

## Evidence Item

Each evidence item explains why the persona exists.

Required fields:

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Stable id, format `evidence_<slug>_<8hex>`. |
| `source_type` | enum | `interview`, `survey`, `analytics`, `support`, `sales`, `desk_research`, or `synthetic`. |
| `summary` | string | What this evidence supports. |
| `confidence` | number | `0` to `1`. |

Optional fields:

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | string | Source title. |
| `source_uri` | string | Link or local reference. |
| `quote` | string | Short source excerpt or paraphrase. |
| `observed_at` | string | ISO 8601 date-time. |

Synthetic evidence is allowed for early prototyping, but it must be labeled with
`source_type: "synthetic"` so UI and exports can distinguish it from real
research.

## Persona Summary

List views should not require full persona payloads.

```ts
type PersonaSummary = Pick<
  Persona,
  | "id"
  | "status"
  | "name"
  | "archetype"
  | "role"
  | "summary"
  | "primary_goal"
  | "confidence"
  | "tags"
  | "updated_at"
>;
```

## Filters

```ts
type PersonaFilters = {
  search?: string;
  status?: Array<"draft" | "active" | "archived">;
  tags?: string[];
  role?: string;
  minConfidence?: number;
  sourceType?: Array<
    "interview" | "survey" | "analytics" | "support" | "sales" | "desk_research" | "synthetic"
  >;
};
```

## Repository Contract

```ts
type PersonaRepository = {
  listPersonas(filters?: PersonaFilters): Promise<PersonaSummary[]>;
  getPersona(id: string): Promise<Persona | null>;
  createPersona(input: PersonaCreateInput): Promise<Persona>;
  updatePersona(id: string, input: PersonaUpdateInput): Promise<Persona>;
  archivePersona(id: string): Promise<Persona>;
  exportPersonas(ids?: string[]): Promise<PersonaExport>;
};
```

Create and update inputs should accept editable fields only. The repository owns
`id`, `schema_version`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.

## Persona Council Contracts

Persona councils are the product workflow for repo-specific synthetic persona
reviews. They sit beside the base `Persona` contract and are owned by
`src/lib/council.ts`.

### RepoPersonaRoster

Required fields:

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `schema_version` | string | Current value: `1.0.0`. |
| `id` | string | Stable id, format `roster_<repo-slug>_<suffix>`. |
| `repo_path` | string | Local repository path. |
| `repo_slug` | string | Repository slug used for display and ids. |
| `source_summary` | string | How the roster was generated or curated. |
| `personas` | array | Roster personas with lens, role, JTBD, decision power, failure modes, and evidence expectations. |
| `default_levels` | object | Persona ids for `low`, `medium`, and `high` review depth. |
| `generated_from` | array | Files, scripts, or prior artifacts used to create the roster. |
| `user_overrides` | array | User-authored changes to generated defaults. |
| `created_at` / `updated_at` | string | ISO 8601 date-time. |

Review-depth bounds:

| Level | Persona Count |
| --- | --- |
| `low` | 2-3 |
| `medium` | 4-7 |
| `high` | 8-20 |

### PersonaReviewRun

Required fields:

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `schema_version` | string | Current value: `1.0.0`. |
| `id` | string | Stable run id. |
| `repo_path` | string | Local repository path. |
| `request` | string | User review request. |
| `council_type` | enum | `ui_test`, `decision`, `strategy`, `prompt`, `research`, `architecture`, or `competitive`. |
| `level` | enum | `low`, `medium`, or `high`. |
| `target_artifacts` | array | Files, docs, flows, or product surfaces under review. |
| `roster_id` | string | Selected roster. |
| `persona_ids` | array | Selected reviewer personas. |
| `measurement_plan_id` | string | Pre-registered measurement plan. |
| `status` | enum | `draft`, `ready`, `running`, `needs_evidence`, `synthesizing`, `complete`, or `archived`. |
| `coordination_mode` | enum | `local`, `host_subagents`, or `rally`. |
| `created_at` / `updated_at` | string | ISO 8601 date-time. |

Related records:

| Record | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `PersonaMeasurementPlan` | Decision supported, target artifact, success/failure signals, evidence required, confidence policy, synthetic policy, and quality gate. |
| `PersonaAssignment` | One persona's model tier, prompt version, status, output path, and evidence gaps. |
| `PersonaFinding` | Claim, severity, evidence/source/assumption support, confidence split, synthetic disclosure, and recommended action. |
| `PersonaSynthesis` | Top findings, dissent, evidence gaps, confidence downgrade reasons, next actions, and decision recommendation. |
| `PromptVersion` | Run-scoped prompt family, model tier, source tool, score, and changelog. |
| `OutcomeComparison` | Baseline, Prompt Builder, and Agent Builder-style comparison notes. |
| `RunEvent` | Local audit log for status transitions and generated artifacts. |

Synthetic or mixed evidence must stay visible through `behavior_source` and
`is_synthetic_disclosed`. Findings must cite at least one evidence id, source
URI, or explicit assumption.

## Storage Contract

V1 should use local file-backed JSON once persistence is implemented.

Storage path:

- `data/personas.json`
- `data/council-rosters.json`
- `data/council-runs.json`

Shape:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0.0",
  "personas": []
}
```

Rules:

- `personas` contains canonical `Persona[]` records.
- `council-rosters.json` contains canonical `RepoPersonaRoster[]` records.
- `council-runs.json` contains runs plus measurement plans, assignments,
  findings, syntheses, prompt versions, outcome comparisons, and events.
- Writes should validate each persona against `schemas/persona.schema.json`.
- Council writes should validate the relevant domain object and write by
  temporary file plus atomic rename.
- Status updates should include the loaded `updated_at` timestamp when possible
  so stale transitions can be rejected.
- Updates should replace one persona by `id`, not rewrite ids.
- Archive should set `status: "archived"` and update `updated_at`.
- Base persona screens may use static fixture data before `data/personas.json`
  exists. Council screens should use the council repository and local JSON
  files, seeded from fixtures only when those files are empty.

ID rules:

- Persona ids: `persona_<slug>_<8hex>`.
- Evidence ids: `evidence_<slug>_<8hex>`.
- Slugs are lowercase, hyphen-separated, and derived from display text.
- The hex suffix is generated at creation time and remains stable.

## HTTP Contract

If the app uses API routes, use these shapes.

### `GET /api/personas`

Query parameters:

- `search`
- `status`
- `tag`
- `role`
- `minConfidence`
- `sourceType`

Response:

```json
{
  "personas": []
}
```

`personas` contains `PersonaSummary[]`.

### `POST /api/personas`

Request body:

```json
{
  "persona": {}
}
```

`persona` contains `PersonaCreateInput`.

Response:

```json
{
  "persona": {}
}
```

`persona` contains the created `Persona`.

### `GET /api/personas/:id`

Response when found:

```json
{
  "persona": {}
}
```

Response when missing:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "not_found",
    "message": "Persona not found."
  }
}
```

### `PUT /api/personas/:id`

Request body:

```json
{
  "persona": {}
}
```

`persona` contains `PersonaUpdateInput`.

Response:

```json
{
  "persona": {}
}
```

### `DELETE /api/personas/:id`

Archives the persona in V1.

Response:

```json
{
  "persona": {}
}
```

### Error Shape

```ts
type ApiError = {
  error: {
    code: "validation_error" | "not_found" | "conflict" | "repository_error";
    message: string;
    fields?: Record<string, string>;
  };
};
```

}
```

## UI Requirements From The Contract

Claude should implement the first shell with these assumptions:

- List cards need `name`, `archetype`, `role`, `summary`, `primary_goal`,
  `confidence`, `status`, and `tags`.
- Detail pages need grouped sections for overview, goals, frustrations,
  motivations, behaviors, needs, scenarios, evidence, and notes.
- Editor fields should handle repeatable string lists and repeatable scenarios.
- Evidence entry is required before a persona can become active.
- The UI should visually distinguish synthetic evidence from real research.
- Archive should be available, but hard delete should not be prominent in V1.
- Empty state should guide the user to create or import the first persona.
- Validation errors should keep unsaved form data intact.

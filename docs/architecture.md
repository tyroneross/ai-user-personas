# AI User Personas Architecture

## Bottom Line

Build the first version as a local-first persona workspace with a stable persona
contract, a thin repository boundary, and council-review screens backed by
local JSON persistence.

The core architecture decision is to separate the persona domain from the UI:
Claude can build list/detail/editor screens against the schema now, while Codex
keeps the data model, validation rules, persistence boundary, and future
generation pipeline explicit.

The persona-review council capability now sits beside the base persona
workspace. It owns repo rosters, review runs, measurement plans, assignments,
findings, synthesis, prompt comparisons, and Agent Builder-style export
packages through `src/lib/council.ts` and the council repository boundary.

## V1 Scope

In scope:

- Create, view, edit, archive, and export AI user personas.
- Preserve evidence and source provenance for every persona.
- Support UI filtering by status, tags, role, confidence, and source type.
- Keep the app usable without a backend by starting with a repository adapter.
- Leave room for later AI-assisted persona generation without blocking the UI.
- Plan low, medium, and high-depth persona review councils.
- Persist council rosters and review runs in local JSON files.
- Show evidence gaps, synthetic disclosure, confidence, and status in the
  `/councils` UI.
- Export council runs as markdown and Agent Builder-style JSON packages.

Out of scope for the first pass:

- Multi-user collaboration.
- Accounts, auth, billing, or cloud sync.
- Fully automated persona generation without human review.
- External CRM, analytics, or research-repository integrations.

## System Shape

```text
UI shell
  -> PersonaRepository interface
    -> Local fixture adapter for first UI build
    -> Browser storage or file-backed adapter for first persistence pass
  -> CouncilRepository interface
    -> File-backed council roster/run adapter
    -> Deterministic persona-plan adapter
    -> Command-packet and export adapters
  -> Persona domain validation
    -> schemas/persona.schema.json
  -> Council domain validation
    -> schemas/persona-roster.schema.json
    -> schemas/persona-review-run.schema.json
  -> Future generation pipeline
    -> raw inputs -> evidence items -> persona draft -> reviewed persona
```

## Ownership Boundaries

Claude-owned UI paths should consume the data contract without redefining the
domain model:

- Persona list and filtering.
- Persona detail view.
- Persona editor/intake form.
- Empty, loading, error, and validation states.
- Visual hierarchy and component interaction model.

Codex-owned architecture/data paths define:

- Persona schema and validation rules.
- API and repository contracts.
- Persistence and import/export boundaries.
- Data flow from source evidence to reviewed persona.
- Handoffs for UI requirements that need frontend implementation.

## Domain Model

The app centers on one canonical entity: `Persona`.

A persona represents a researched or synthesized user archetype. It must include:

- Human-readable identity: name, archetype, summary, role, and tags.
- Behavioral model: goals, frustrations, motivations, behaviors, needs, and
  scenarios.
- Evidence model: source references, confidence, and provenance notes.
- Lifecycle state: draft, active, or archived.
- Timestamps and schema version for migrations.

The canonical JSON Schema lives at
`schemas/persona.schema.json`.

## Data Flow

1. User enters or imports source material.
2. Input is normalized into evidence items with source metadata.
3. The app creates a persona draft manually or through a future AI-generation
   step.
4. A human edits and approves the draft.
5. The repository stores the persona as the canonical JSON shape.
6. The UI renders list, detail, compare, and export views from that shape.

## Repository Boundary

Use a small repository interface rather than binding the UI directly to storage.

```ts
type PersonaRepository = {
  listPersonas(filters?: PersonaFilters): Promise<PersonaSummary[]>;
  getPersona(id: PersonaId): Promise<Persona | null>;
  createPersona(input: PersonaCreateInput): Promise<Persona>;
  updatePersona(id: PersonaId, input: PersonaUpdateInput): Promise<Persona>;
  archivePersona(id: PersonaId): Promise<Persona>;
  exportPersonas(ids?: PersonaId[]): Promise<PersonaExport>;
};
```

Implementation options by surface:

- Base persona scaffold: static fixture data that conforms to the persona
  schema until `data/personas.json` is wired.
- Browser-first persona app: localStorage adapter with import/export JSON.
- Next.js/API persona app: file-backed JSON adapter behind `/api/personas`.
- Council workflow: file-backed JSON adapter behind server actions and
  `/councils` routes.

The UI should not care which adapter is active.

Council reviews use the same boundary rule. `CouncilRepository` owns roster,
run, measurement-plan, assignment, finding, synthesis, prompt-version,
outcome-comparison, and event records. The file-backed server adapter reads
`data/council-rosters.json` and `data/council-runs.json`, seeds the first
review from fixtures when the files are empty, validates writes, writes via a
temporary file and rename, and rejects stale status transitions when the loaded
`updated_at` timestamp no longer matches.

## V1 Implementation Decisions

Approved UI stack:

- Next.js 16 App Router.
- TypeScript.
- Tailwind for styling.
- React state and server actions before adding a state library.

Approved V1 storage:

- Use local file-backed JSON behind the repository boundary.
- Store canonical records in `data/personas.json` once persistence is added.
- Store council records in `data/council-rosters.json` and
  `data/council-runs.json`.
- The base persona UI may continue to use static fixtures until persona
  persistence lands; the council UI uses file-backed JSON with fixture seeding.
- Defer SQLite, Drizzle, Neon, and external databases until the local JSON
  adapter becomes a real constraint.

Approved ID strategy:

- Persona id format: `persona_<slug>_<8hex>`.
- Evidence id format: `evidence_<slug>_<8hex>`.
- The slug should come from the human-readable name or evidence title.
- The hex suffix should be generated when the record is created and should not
  change when display fields are edited.

## API Boundary

If the app uses HTTP endpoints, keep them narrow:

- `GET /api/personas`
- `POST /api/personas`
- `GET /api/personas/:id`
- `PUT /api/personas/:id`
- `DELETE /api/personas/:id`
- `POST /api/personas/export`

`DELETE` should archive by default in V1. Hard delete can be deferred.

## State Flow

Recommended frontend state:

- Server/repository state: persona list and detail payloads.
- Form state: unsaved persona edits.
- View state: selected persona id, filters, sort, active tab, compare selection.
- Validation state: field-level schema errors and save-blocking errors.

Avoid duplicating complete persona objects across unrelated stores. Keep one
loaded detail record and lightweight summaries for lists.

## Error And Validation Rules

Save should be blocked when:

- `name`, `archetype`, `summary`, `primary_goal`, or `evidence` is missing.
- Confidence is outside `0..1`.
- Required arrays are empty.
- A source reference lacks `source_type` or `summary`.
- The record does not match `schemas/persona.schema.json`.

UI should surface validation near the field that caused it and preserve unsaved
input after a failed save.

## UI Handoff Requirements

Claude should build the first UI shell around these contract-backed screens:

- Persona dashboard: searchable list with status, confidence, tags, and primary
  goal visible.
- Persona detail: overview, goals, frustrations, motivations, scenarios,
  evidence, and notes.
- Persona editor: required fields, repeatable list controls, confidence input,
  evidence/source fields, save/archive actions, and validation states.
- Empty state: prompt to create or import the first persona.
- Error state: readable repository/validation error with retry where relevant.

The base persona UI can start with static fixture data as long as the fixture
validates against the schema. The council UI should use the council repository
and local JSON files so run creation and status transitions persist.

## Open Decisions

- AI generation should remain behind a draft/review boundary. No generated
  persona should become active without human acceptance.
- Base persona persistence still needs an owner and exact module path.
